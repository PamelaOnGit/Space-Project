## Timeframe and working team

This was a solo project, completed during week 12 of the General Assembly Flex Software Engineering Immersive, over a period of 9 days.

## Brief

The brief was broad: to create a single page app using React and an API; and to deploy it using Netifly.  I had been fascinated by the images and information shared on the NASA API and had seen a fun project in which the OpenNotify API was used to track the progress of the International Space Station.  I decided to build my own ISS tracker.
